# Answer Status Inquiry System
Create a data query system: 
> Enter a start and end time, and the system will count the results of each question uploaded during that time.
> Initially, the system displays the results as a 6Ã—5 report with four columns filled with Problem Status and five answer conditions:
>   > Accepted, Compile Error, Runtime Error, Time Limit Exceeded, and Wrong Answer.
> The leftmost column is Problem Status, and the rest of the columns are in order from Problem 1 to Problem 4.
> The other parts of the report are filled with the corresponding number of uploaded results, for example, the numbers in the third and fourth columns are: the number of RuntimeErrors corresponding to Problem2 from the start time to the end time of the query.
